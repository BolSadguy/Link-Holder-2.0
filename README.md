This item is a 3D printable holder for the Phreakmods Link and Link EX Groove. It uses the OSBMX screw-in buttons from the OpenStickCommunity hardware repo as a base and mounts in a 24mm hole, like a pushbutton.

The mounting stub is part of the STL; all you need is a 24mm hole to mount it in and a single washer from the OSBMX repo (https://github.com/TheTrainGoes/GP2040-Projects/tree/main/Open%20Source%20Buttons/OSBMX)

It also holds a 24mm rubber lever hole plug, which you can get on aliexpress (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001797243602.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.22.656f1802g4zsxH)

Test prints were done in black resin from JLCPCB.
